  copy: In one of my research projects, I study how Hungarian firms managed by foreign CEOs perform relative to those managed by domestic CEOs. I need to merge data on firm performance to data on manager nationality. This latter data we have collected ourselves in our research lab, based on manager names. I recently noticed a data fluke that made us classify some Hungarian names in the early 1990s as foreign. Once found, it was relatively easy to fix. Now I want to make sure that my team uses the newer, better data product for manager nationality as opposed to the old one.
