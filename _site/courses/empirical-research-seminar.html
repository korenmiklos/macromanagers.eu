<p>This course guides you through the process of empirical research in applied microeconomics, from selecting research ideas and appropriate methods, through collecting data, to submitting your final paper to a journal. We wonâ€™t talk about these steps, we will do these steps together. Each student and instructor completes a paper during the two terms of the course, which they submit at the end of the course to peer-reviewed journals.</p>
