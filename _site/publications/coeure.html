<p>We survey the recent economics literature on international trade and global production. We identify five areas where further research would help policy makers: gains from global production sharing, more quantitative analysis of the redistribution effects of globalization, a better understanding of cross-border frictions, and estimates of the side effect of trade. With the goal of providing a research agenda, we identify nineteen specific challenges for measurement, theory, and policy analysis.</p>
