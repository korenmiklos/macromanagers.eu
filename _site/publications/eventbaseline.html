<p>eventbaseline is a Stata package that transforms the coefficients estimated by xthdidregress into a correct event study relative to a baseline. The reported coefficients are the average treatment effects on the treated (ATT) for each period relative to the baseline. The baseline can be either a period before the treatment or the average of the pre-treatment periods.</p>
