intro: "What is the role of managers and entrepreneurs in economic development? It is understood that good management practices can improve business performance, but what policy interventions can help such practices spread? We build quantifiable equilbrium models and estimate them on 40 years of micro data from Austria, Germany and Hungary to answer these questions."
